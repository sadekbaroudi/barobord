My todo list for new features:
* Add support for kicad top plate to include openings for rotary encoders and oled / pimoroni trackball
* Add break off number row and 6th columns on left and right for additional side keys
* (complete for MX version, not for byo-mcu or choc versions) Add underglow support. When adding support, extend the LEDs from the SK6812 mini-e to WS2812b, and add jumpers that route the LED pin from the atmega to the underglow directly so that you have the option of using underglow only
* Redo all the mounting holes so that they are the same positions on all versions of the barobord
* Can I add support for the atmega32u4-mu as well as the au? If I can support both, would be nice, gives flexibility during fabrication to use either
