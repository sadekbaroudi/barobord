# Firmware

Depending on the features on your keyboard, download the appropriate firmware (.hex file) from this directory and flash it onto your keyboard.

Once you have done that, make sure you have [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) installed.

Download the following [via.json](https://github.com/sadekbaroudi/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/xoiviox/barobord/via.json) file and load it into Vial by clicking the File menu, and then "Sideload VIA JSON..."

Now, update your keymap on the fly without ever having to reflash your keyboard again!
